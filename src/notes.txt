create a parameters trait for parameters like m, n, ell

stateless prover/verify function

modularize might require defining state objects

look at ark-marlin mostly :)

comparison with 


        // if G and H are subgroups, V_G, V_H are vanishing polys, G is subgroup of H
        // A(X) = 0 over G, B(X) = 0 over H
        // A(X) * V_H(X) / V_G(X) + alpha * B(X) = 0 over H

G = 96 bytes

14 G
1 BatchProof = 4 * (96 + 48) bytes
27 F 

96 * 14 + 4 * (96 + 48) + 27 * 48 = 3216 bytes
